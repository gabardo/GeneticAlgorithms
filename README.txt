Genetic Algorithms Project
--------------------------
This project is the result of my studies in genetic algorithms.  My goal is to understand and learn the discipline of evolutionary computation through my studies of a particular clustering algorithm which is implemented as a genetic algorithm. The algorithm is called Multi-Objective Clustering with K-Determination and requires me to understand many concepts new to me.

-------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------
1) matplotlib
2) numpy

-------------------------
Run Tests
-------------------------
$ ./runTests.sh


-------------------------
Run the Code
-------------------------
The ga.sh shell script runs the python genetic algorithm tools in this project.

$ ./ga.sh
Setting PYTHONPATH to /Users/val/Workspaces/python/GeneticAlgorithms/src
Choose [C]oin Toss, [R]andom number [S]imple GA [T]SP:
Enter seed random number (0.0..1.0): .98348794567
0.98348794567

In 1000 coin tosses there were 495 heads and 505 tails.

-------------------------
Things I want to do
-------------------------
1) Test Mock on artificial datasets
2) Parallelize Mock algorithm
